# Pong

This is an example project for examination of refactoring practices on [rubylove.io](http://rubylove.io). The original concept and source code was presented @ RubyMadison 2013 by Michael Fairly.

His project [Hasu](https://github.com/michaelfairley/hasu) is awesome. This refactor is in no sense a 'dig' on Michael's code. Code written for a presentation needs to be readable without too many disambiguations. However, in production code, abstractions are the way of life.
